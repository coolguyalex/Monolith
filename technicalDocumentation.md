 # 0.96 Inch OLED Display Screen Module
Note: The 7-bit I2C address of the 0.96-inch OLED screen is 0111100 (0x3C). 0x78 in the PCB is 0111100, and the 8th bit represents the "write" operation. If the code only specifies the I2C slave device address, use the 7-bit binary code (such as 0x3C).

    Display Type: OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
    Resolution: 128x64 pixels
    Interface: I2C Operating Voltage: 3.3V - 5V
    Minimum Visible Angle: 160 Degree
    Energy Consumption (Normally): 0.06w
    View Angle：>160°
    Diyplay Dimensions: 0.91 inches (diagonal)
    Working Temperature: -20°C to 60°C
    Driver IC: SSD1306 Displya
    Color: Blue and Yellow

# WWZMDiB Micro SD TF Card Adapter Reader Module with Logic Level Chip 3.3V 5V 6 Pin SPI Interface
