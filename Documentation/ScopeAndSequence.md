# Social Practice  
**Semester Course – Scope & Sequence**  
**Instructors:** Brittni Harvey & Alexander Sousa  
**Format:** Project-based, interdisciplinary studio + seminar  
**Core Project:** EnviroSound (Public Environmental Sound Sculpture)

---

## Course Description

Social Practice is an interdisciplinary, project-based course exploring how art, science, and technology operate within public life. Students investigate environmental data, community contexts, and systems of power through hands-on making, collaborative research, and public-facing work.

The course centers on **EnviroSound**, a data-driven environmental sculpture that translates local environmental conditions into sound. Students will design, build, analyze, and contextualize this work while examining broader questions of climate change, environmental justice, public art, and civic engagement.

Rather than treating art, science, or engineering as isolated disciplines, Social Practice treats them as **social tools**—ways of sensing, interpreting, and intervening in the world.

## Core Questions (Spiral Themes)

- How does data become meaningful to people?
- What responsibilities do artists and scientists have in public space?
- How can environmental monitoring function as both research and storytelling?
- Who is included—or excluded—by technological systems?
- What does it mean to make work *with* a community rather than *for* one?

These questions recur throughout the semester at increasing levels of complexity.

## Pedagogical Structure

- **Alternating Instruction:**  
  - Weeks alternate between **artistic / social inquiry focus** (Harvey) and **technical / scientific focus** (Sousa), with intentional overlap.
- **Studio + Seminar Hybrid:**  
  - Each unit blends discussion, skill-building, critique, and fabrication.
- **Public Outcome:**  
  - Work culminates in a real-world installation and public engagement.

## Assessment Philosophy

Assessment prioritizes:
- Process over polish
- Reflection over correctness
- Collaboration over individual heroics

Evaluation draws from:
- Participation and engagement
- Iterative artifacts
- Critical reflection
- Contribution to shared outcomes

---

## Alignment with EnviroSound Objectives

This course directly supports the EnviroSound goals of:
- Environmental literacy
- Workforce-relevant technical skills
- Public engagement with climate data
- Open, replicable educational models

## Closing Note

Social Practice is not about mastering tools for their own sake.  
It is about learning how **tools shape relationships**—between people, environments, and futures.

The course remains intentionally unfinished. Like the climate systems it studies, it evolves.
